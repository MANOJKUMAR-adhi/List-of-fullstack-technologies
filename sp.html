    <p>The Spring Framework is a widely-used, open-source Java framework that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for building applications. It simplifies the development process by handling many of the underlying details, allowing developers to focus on the business logic of their applications. Spring is known for its focus on dependency injection (DI) and aspect-oriented programming (AOP), which promotes a cleaner, more modular, and testable code structure. </p>
