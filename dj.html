    <p>Django—pronounced “Jango,” named after the famous jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt—is a free, open source framework that was first publicly released in 2005. Django facilitates “rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.” The Django web framework, deployed on a web server, can help developers quickly produce a web frontend that’s feature-rich, secure and scalable.

Starting with the Django web framework is more efficient way to build a web app than starting from scratch, which requires building the backend, APIs, javascript and sitemaps. With the Django web framework, web developers can focus on creating a unique application and benefit from greater flexibility than using a web development tool.</p>
