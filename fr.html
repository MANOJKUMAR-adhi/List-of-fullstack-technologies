    <p>A backend framework is a collection of tools, libraries, and standards designed to help developers build web applications more quickly and efficiently. They provide the structure and architecture to manage requests from clients, access databases, and organize the applicationâ€™s business logic. By using a backend framework, developers can focus on developing application features and functionality, without having to worry about request processing and other technical details.
        Here are some examples of popular and accessible backend frameworks for beginners:

Express.js: A minimalist framework for Node.js. Easy to learn and very flexible.
Django: A powerful Python framework that provides a variety of built-in features, including an authentication system and admin panel.
Ruby on Rails: A highly productive Ruby framework with more conventions than configurations.
Laravel: An elegant PHP framework with clear syntax and a user-friendly interface.
